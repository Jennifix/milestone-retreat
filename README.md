# The Milestone Retreat

You can find The Milestone Retreat in the heart of the forest and this webpage was made to help you find the way.

## UX

The user of this webpage is someone who:
* is interested in personal growth
* is stressed and need to get away
* looking to do charity work

This page is made to bring visitors to the retreat.

The user of this page is looking for:
* vacation 
* personal growth
* activites

My biggest priority was to make the website easy to navigate through as well choosing appealing images and colors. I decided to go with a dark theme to make it easy on the eyes.

## Features

All of the pages use the same navigation bar and footer to keep the whole website consistent. All of the pages has a image to set the feel of a cozy dark forest.

#### The home page
This page is the most detailed out of all the pages, it features a section with short information about the retreat and a section with testimonials.

The image on top of the page is meant to set the mood.

The information section of the page links to the about page for more information

#### The about page
The first thing you see on this page is an image that is supposed to show the cottage. As you scroll down the page two sections with information about the retrat and "What We Do" together with a embedded youtube video will show.

#### The calendar page
This page is a very simple page as it is only meant to let the user know about all of the activites and events that the retreat hosts. Theres an image on the top of the page to set a cozy mood. 

The calendar is an embedded Google Calendar. 

As I was going through code of different calendars I realised that they were very complicated.
I also realised that it anyone that works at the retreat would easily be able to update the schedule to Googles scheduling system.

#### The contact page
This pages starts with an image to set the mood, as all of the other pages. Underneath the images is the contact form where the user writes their first name, last name, email adress and a message. A fictional adress is shown to the right of the the forms.

## Deployment

The website was written on Cloud9, which I also used push my project to GitHub, using Git.

This project is hosted by GitHub. I deployed it by going into the settings of the repositry and scrolled down until I found the GitHub Pages section. I then click the dropdown menu that says "None" and choose Master Branch. The page refreshes automatically and the link to the deployed site can be found in the GitHub Pages section on the same page.

To run the code locally you have to go to the repositry and download the URL shown when you click the "Clone or download" button. You then open up the terminal in your IDE and type "git clone" plus the URL and then hit enter.
